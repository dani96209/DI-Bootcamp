        "Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It is crucial for data analysts as it helps uncover insights, automate decision-making, and improve the accuracy of predictions across various industries:\n",
